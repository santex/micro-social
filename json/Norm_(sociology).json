Sociologists describe norms as informal understandings that govern\nsocietyâs behaviors, Marshall, G. Oxford Dictionary of\nSociology. while psychologists have adopted a more general definition,\nrecognizing smaller group units, like a team or an office, may also endorse\nnorms separate or in addition to cultural or societal expectations. Jackson, J. (1965). Structural characteristics of norms. In I.D.\nSteiner & M. Fishbein (Eds.), Current studies in social psychology (pp. 301-\n309). The psychological definition emphasizes social norms' behavioral\ncomponent, stating norms have two dimensions: how much behavior is exhibited and\nhow much the group approves of that behavior.\n\nNorms running counter to the behaviours of the overarching society or culture\nmay be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society. For\nexample, Crandall (1988) noted that certain groups (e.g., cheerleading squads,\ndance troupes, sports teams, sororities) have a rate of bulimia, a publicly\nrecognized life-threatening disease, that is much higher than society as a\nwhole. Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups. Haung, Peter, Wu, Ho-Mou. \"More Order without More Law: A Theory of\nSocial Norms and Organizational Cultures\".
