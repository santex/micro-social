Thorstein Veblen's (1899) The Theory of the\nLeisure Class is generally seen as the first major theoretical work to take\nconsumption as its primary focus. Despite these early roots, research on\nconsumption began in earnest in the second half of the twentieth century in\nEurope, especially Great Britain. Interest in the topic among US sociologists\nwas much slower to develop and it is still not a focal concern of many American\nsociologists. Efforts are currently underway to form a section in the American\nSociological Association devoted to the study of consumption.\n\nModern theorists of consumption include Jean Baudrillard, Pierre Bourdieu, and\nGeorge Ritzer.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Consumption_(sociology)","recorded":1362585089,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Sociology index"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg/40px-Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sociology","Karl_Marx","Thorstein_Veblen","American_Sociological_Association","Jean_Baudrillard","Pierre_Bourdieu","George_Ritzer","Consumer_theory","Consumerism","Over-consumption","Waste"]}
