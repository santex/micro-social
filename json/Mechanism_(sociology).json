Usuallyâ¦ this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause\nof the event we want to explainâ¦. [But] to cite the cause is not enough: the\ncausal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.â\n\nExisting definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them\nall is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by\nspecifying in detail how they were brought about. The currently most\nsatisfactory discussion of the mechanism concept is found in Machamer, Darden\nand Craver (2000). Following them, mechanisms can be said to consist of entities\n(with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either\nby themselves or in concert with other entities. These activities bring about\nchange, and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and\nactivities of the entities and the relations between them. A mechanism, thus\ndefined, refers to a constellation of entities and activities that are organized\nsuch that they regularly bring about a particular type of outcome, and we\nexplain an observed outcome by referring to the mechanism by which such outcomes\nare regularly brought about (see also HedstrÃ¶m and Ylikoski 2010).\n","linknr":82,"url":"Mechanism_(sociology)","recorded":1362478811,"links":11,"instances":["philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Economics terminology"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mechanism","philosophy"],["mechanism","philosophy"]],"members":["mechanism"],"related":["Mechanism_(philosophy)","Philosophy_of_science","Jon_Elster","Peter_Hedstrom","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Analytical_sociology","Critical_realism","Methodological_individualism","Explanation"]}
