{"cursor":"3207","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the social sciences, 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act\nindependently and to make their own free choices. By contrast, structure are\nthose factors of influence (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity,\ncustoms, etc.) that determine or limit an agent and his or her\ndecisions.

ISBN 0-7619-4156-8 p448 The relative difference\nin influences from structure and agency is debated â it's unclear to what extent\na person's actions are constrained by social systems.\n\nOne's agency is one's independent capability or ability to act on one's will.\nThis ability is affected by the cognitive belief structure which one has formed\nthrough one's experiences, and the perceptions held by the society and the\nindividual, of the structures and circumstances of the environment one is in and\nthe position they are born into. Disagreement on the extent of one's agency\noften causes conflict between parties, e.g. parents and children.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Agency_(sociology)","recorded":1372152282,"links":[],"instances":["sociology","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Sociology index"],"headings":["Feelings of agency","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["action_theory","sociology"],["agency","philosophy"]],"members":["action_theory","agency"],"related":["Social_sciences","Social_structure","Structure_and_agency","Daniel_Wegner","Illusion_of_control","Self_serving_bias","Evolution","Intention","Action_theory_(sociology)","Agency_(philosophy)","Negative_capability","Social_action","Social_relation","Structure_and_agency","Theory_of_structuration"]}
